# Mach Language

The basic idea is that mach is intended to be a successor to the C language, with a focus on simplicity and efficiency. It is designed to be a low-level language that can be used for systems programming, embedded systems, and other performance-critical applications.
Its syntax is simple, familiar, and easy to parse (programatically or by a human). There are no "black box" features, and everything is designed to be explicit and clear.
Mach includes absolutely zero batteries (even the standard library is optional).
It has full, native C interop.
